204
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,540

205
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,041
He's a plague, Tony.

206
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,076
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

207
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,313
He wipes out
half the population.

208
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,582
He sent Loki.

209
00:14:14,584 --> 00:14:17,520

that's him.

210

212

No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.

213
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:24,924
That already makes him

214
00:14:24,926 --> 00:14:26,627
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

215
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:30,163
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,298
He could destroy life

217
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,467
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

218
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,469

"hitherto undreamt of"?

219

222

If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

223
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,215
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

224
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,450
No can do.

225
00:14:50,452 --> 00:14:53,253
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

227

232
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,331
Point is, things change.

233
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,434
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.

234
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,602
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

235
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,503
Yeah, so conversely,

236
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:12,639
it may also be
his best chance against us.

we have this stone.

We know where it is.

244

Vision is out there somewhere

248

off his transponder.

252

I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,959
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

537
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:49,163
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,163
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:53,532
I feel your pain as well,
because...

540
00:31:53,534 --> 00:31:54,933
I mean,
it's not a competition,

541
00:31:54,935 --> 00:31:56,168
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,036
- My father killed my mother.
- (SLURPING)

543
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,204
And then I had to kill
my father.

544
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:00,939
- That was hard.
- (SIGHS)

545
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,276
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

546
00:32:04,278 --> 00:32:07,312
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

547
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,083
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:14,453
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

549
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:17,155
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

550
00:32:17,157 --> 00:32:20,525
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.

551

(PETER CLEARS THROAT)

552
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:23,230
(IN DEEP VOICE)
No, you're not.

553
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:29,468
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

554
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,972
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

555
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,541
- No.
- You are.

556
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:39,444
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

557
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,945
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:42,949
- (GASPS) He just did it again!
- This is my voice.

559
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:50,455
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:53,991
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.

561
00:32:53,993 --> 00:32:55,059
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,193
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:58,028
- GAMORA: Enough!
- He's doing it first.

564
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,464
We need to stop Thanos.

565
00:32:59,466 --> 00:33:01,165
Which means
we need to find out

566
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,300
where he's going next.

567
00:33:02,302 --> 00:33:03,635
Knowhere.

568
00:33:03,637 --> 00:33:05,504
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,639
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, no. Knowhere?

570
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,509
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

571
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:13,378
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.

572
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,648
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?

573
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,115
THOR: Because for years...

574
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:20,317
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there

575
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,986
with a man
called the Collector.

576
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:23,588
PETER: If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.

577
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,490
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

578
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:27,124
- Or a genius.
- GAMORA: How do you know...

579
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,694
he's not going
for one of the other stones?

580
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:32,329
There are six stones
out there.

581
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,633
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...

582
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:38,436
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.

583
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:40,605
He stole the Space Stone
from me...

584
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,474
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

585
00:33:43,476 --> 00:33:45,242
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.

586
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,510
They're with the Avengers.

587
00:33:46,512 --> 00:33:49,046
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.

588
00:33:49,048 --> 00:33:50,281
Like Kevin Bacon?

589
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:51,582
He may be on the team.
I don't know.

590
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:52,650
I haven't been there
in a while.

591
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:55,219
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.

592
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,054
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:57,056 --> 00:33:58,723
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:00,424
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.

595
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:03,093
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.

596
00:34:03,095 --> 00:34:04,261
You're welcome.

597
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:05,563
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.

598
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:09,667
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.

599
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:11,669
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.

600
00:34:11,671 --> 00:34:15,072
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:16,707
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,309
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

603
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,478
(CHUCKLING)
to ever torment the universe.

604
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,646
I would very much like
to go there, please.

605
00:34:22,648 --> 00:34:23,714
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:24,815
and clearly the smartest
among you.

607
00:34:24,817 --> 00:34:25,850
Rabbit?

608
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:28,519
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

609
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,820
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

610
00:34:29,822 --> 00:34:31,155
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:32,389
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,191
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?

613
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:37,161
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

614
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:39,096
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!

615
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:40,264
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

616
00:34:40,266 --> 00:34:41,465
THOR: Quiet.

617
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,133
- That's my backpack.
- ROCKET: Go sit down.

619
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:47,571
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,774
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

621
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:51,842
The Thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:53,577
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

623
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:55,746
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

624
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,080
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:57,082 --> 00:34:58,349
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

626
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,417
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

627
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,685
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:35:01,687 --> 00:35:03,152
If we don't go to Knowhere

629
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,755
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...

630
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,524
he'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,793
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.

632
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,628
We got two ships

633
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,262
and a large assortment
of morons.

634
00:35:12,264 --> 00:35:15,599
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

635
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:16,801
And the morons
will go to Knowhere

636
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,602
to try to stop Thanos.

you're going with him

640
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:25,442
because it's where
Thanos isn't.

641
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:27,110
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,214
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.

I didn't go back?

Like to think of myself

901
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,682
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.

902
00:52:19,684 --> 00:52:21,851
- Let her go.
- Peter.

910
00:53:00,424 --> 00:53:01,425
Do it.

You know they're
only criminals because

you've chosen to

That's right.

I paid for that.

Nat.

963
00:56:22,725 --> 00:56:24,359
This is awkward.

964
00:56:26,763 --> 00:56:28,529
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

965
00:56:28,531 --> 00:56:29,798
And they can clearly find us.

966
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,398
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

- Ant-Man.

There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

972
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,042
Okay, look.

973
00:56:42,044 --> 00:56:45,112
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

974
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:48,651
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

975
00:56:50,518 --> 00:56:51,685
Vision's stone.

976
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,020
Then we have to protect it.

977
00:56:53,022 --> 00:56:54,723
No, we have to destroy it.

978
00:56:56,859 --> 00:56:58,158
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

979
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,492
to this entity in my head.

980
00:56:59,494 --> 00:57:01,527
About its nature.

981
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:03,798
But also its composition.

982
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,866
I think if it were exposed

983
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:07,868
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

984
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:11,739
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

985
00:57:13,408 --> 00:57:15,976
its molecular integrity
could fail.

986
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:18,744
Yeah, and you with it.

987
00:57:18,746 --> 00:57:20,446
We're not having
this conversation.

VISION: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

989
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:24,952
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.

990
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:27,122
That's too high a price.

991
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:34,029
Only you have
the power to pay it.

half the universe.

993

One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

994
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:44,706
But it should.

995
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,741
We don't trade lives, Vision.

996
00:57:48,743 --> 00:57:50,843
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

997
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,812
to save how many
millions of people?

998
00:57:52,814 --> 00:57:54,981
Tell me,
why is this any different?

999
00:57:54,983 --> 00:57:57,418

have a choice.

all of them
learning from one another.

1005
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:11,931
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?

1006
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:15,134
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

1007
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:16,736
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.

1008
00:58:16,738 --> 00:58:18,571

1009
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:19,841

01:01:30,764 --> 01:01:31,829
What's your plan?

1067
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:32,966
- Go.
- Um...

1068
01:01:33,699 --> 01:01:35,266
Okay, okay... Uh...

1069
01:01:35,268 --> 01:01:38,702
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, <i>Aliens?</i>

1070
01:01:38,704 --> 01:01:40,706
(SCREAMING)

1071
01:01:42,209 --> 01:01:45,110
EBONY MAW:
Painful, aren't they?

1072
01:01:45,112 --> 01:01:48,812
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

1073
01:01:48,814 --> 01:01:50,883
- And any one of them...
- (THUD)

1074
01:01:55,955 --> 01:01:58,790
could end your friend's life
in an instant.

1075
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:00,425
IRON MAN: <i>I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.</i>

1076
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:03,163
<i>Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.</i>

1077
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:07,698
You've saved nothing.

1078
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,767
Your powers
are inconsequential

1079
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,269
compared to mine.

1080
01:02:11,271 --> 01:02:12,972
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

1081
01:02:16,443 --> 01:02:17,643

1084
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,255
SPIDER-MAN: Yes! Wait.
What are those?

1085
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:33,759
(YELLING)

1086
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:40,432
(GRUNTS)

1087
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,739
SPIDER-MAN: Hey,
we haven't officially met.

1088
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,041
Cool.

1089
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:52,509
We gotta turn
this ship around.

1090
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:54,878
STARK: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

1091
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,313
No, I want to protect
the stone.

1092
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,748
STARK: And I want you
to thank me.

1093
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,283
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

1094
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:02,186
DR. STRANGE: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

1095
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:04,521
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

1096
01:03:04,523 --> 01:03:05,389
I seriously don't know

1097
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:06,557
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1098
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,393
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1099
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:11,128
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1100
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,197
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

1101
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,932
And due to that fact,

1102
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:16,333
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1103
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:18,202
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.

1104
01:03:18,204 --> 01:03:20,270
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.

1105
01:03:20,272 --> 01:03:21,338
The adults are talking.

1106
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,208
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1107
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,043
What is he, your ward?

1108
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:27,444
No.

1109
01:03:27,446 --> 01:03:29,479
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

1110
01:03:29,481 --> 01:03:31,250
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1111
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:34,351
I'm Spider-Man, then.

1112
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,019
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1113
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,154
Thing's on autopilot.

1114
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:39,056
DR. STRANGE:
Can we control it?

1115
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:40,993
Fly us home?

1116
01:03:43,996 --> 01:03:45,128
- Stark?
- Yeah.

1117
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:46,463
Can you get us home?

1118
01:03:46,465 --> 01:03:47,865
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,470
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.

1120
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:53,869
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,440
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.

1122
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:57,840
I don't think
you quite understand

1123
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:58,775
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:01,378
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1125
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,314
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:04,316 --> 01:04:06,048
Since he sent an army
to New York

1127
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,817
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:09,885
And I don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,020
So I'm not so sure

1130
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:13,055
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:16,892
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1132
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,195
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:22,131
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1134
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:23,134
Doctor.

1135
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,438
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:31,477
All right, Stark.
We go to him.

1137
01:04:32,544 --> 01:04:34,910
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,513
if it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:36,515 --> 01:04:39,215
or the kid
or the Time Stone...

1140
01:04:39,217 --> 01:04:42,952
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:42,954 --> 01:04:47,156
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1142
01:04:47,158 --> 01:04:50,061
Nice. Good, moral compass.
(PATS ARM)

1143
01:04:51,296 --> 01:04:52,897

1144
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:55,400
(SIGHS) All right, kid.

1145
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:57,869
You're an Avenger now.

1146
01:05:34,339 --> 01:05:36,574
THANOS: I thought
you might be hungry.

1147
01:05:48,686 --> 01:05:50,486
I always hated that chair.

1148
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,255
THANOS: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:53,257 --> 01:05:57,195
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:57,994 --> 01:05:59,430
I hated this room.

1151
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,697
This ship.

1152
01:06:01,699 --> 01:06:03,534
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:08,071 --> 01:06:10,274
THANOS: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:13,411 --> 01:06:14,911
Every day.

1155
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,517
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:22,152 --> 01:06:24,489
I was a child
when you took me.

1157
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,657
I saved you.

1158
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,260
No.

1159
01:06:32,663 --> 01:06:36,432
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1160
01:06:36,434 --> 01:06:38,166
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:40,068
scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:43,037
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1163
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,474
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:45,476 --> 01:06:47,476
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1165
01:06:47,478 --> 01:06:49,678
The children born...

1166
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,314
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1167
01:06:53,316 --> 01:06:54,519
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:57,254 --> 01:06:59,287
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1169
01:06:59,289 --> 01:07:02,323
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1170
01:07:02,325 --> 01:07:03,458
You're insane.

1171
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,560
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1172
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:09,030
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1173
01:07:09,032 --> 01:07:13,368
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1174
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,569
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:14,571 --> 01:07:16,072
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:17,507 --> 01:07:20,375
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1177
01:07:20,377 --> 01:07:24,548
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1178
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,217
For a time...

1179
01:07:29,686 --> 01:07:34,090
you had that same will...

1180
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:38,094
as you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:40,030
Daughter.

1182
01:07:40,664 --> 01:07:42,499
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:47,637
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1184
01:07:48,472 --> 01:07:50,071
And, in doing so,

1185
01:07:50,073 --> 01:07:52,275
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1186
01:07:55,212 --> 01:07:58,081
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

1187
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:04,252
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1188
01:08:04,254 --> 01:08:05,386
(THANOS SIGHS)

1189
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:08,055
I am disappointed.

1190
01:08:08,057 --> 01:08:10,427
But not because
you didn't find it.

1191
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:15,699
But because you did.

1192
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,068
And you lied.

1193
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:37,253
GAMORA: Nebula.

1194
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:45,860
Don't do this.

1195
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:47,294
THANOS: Some time ago,

1196
01:08:47,296 --> 01:08:50,197
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1197
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:51,265
Please don't do this.

1198
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:53,503
THANOS:
And very nearly succeeded.

1199
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:55,605
So I brought her here.

1200
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:58,440
To talk.

1201

1202
01:09:06,148 --> 01:09:08,484
Stop. Stop it.

1203
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:17,257
I swear to you on my life.

1204
01:09:17,259 --> 01:09:19,495
I never found the Soul Stone.

1205
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,399
NEBULA:
<i>Accessing memory files.</i>

1206
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:26,802
<i>You know
what he's about to do.</i>

1207
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:29,603
<i>He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.</i>

1208
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:30,806
<i>- All of them.
- He can never get them all.</i>

1209
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:31,873
NEBULA: <i>He will!</i>

1210
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:34,174
<i>He can't, Nebula.</i>

1211
01:09:34,176 --> 01:09:36,577
<i>Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...</i>

1212
01:09:36,579 --> 01:09:39,415
<i>and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.</i>

1213
01:09:44,453 --> 01:09:46,288
You're strong.

1214
01:09:48,324 --> 01:09:49,325
Me.

1215
01:09:51,795 --> 01:09:53,462
You're generous.

1216
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,731
Me.

1217
01:09:57,733 --> 01:10:00,400
But I never taught you to lie.

1218
01:10:00,402 --> 01:10:03,105
That's why
you're so bad at it.

1219
01:10:05,274 --> 01:10:09,712

We're not looking.
What's there to see?

01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:01,928
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

You speak Groot?

1234
01:11:07,368 --> 01:11:09,536
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.

1235

I am Groot.

1243

Yeah, that could be annoying.

1244

Well, he's been dead before.

it really might be true.

your sister and your dad?

we're talkin' about...

would've rather killed me,

I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

to feel my vengeance.

No, he gave me 100 credits.

that night and stole his eye.

1412
01:21:19,443 --> 01:21:21,477
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1413
01:21:21,479 --> 01:21:22,846
It's a mold.

1414
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:25,413
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:25,415 --> 01:21:28,383
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.

1416
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:31,419
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1417
01:21:31,421 --> 01:21:32,989
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,890
Stormbreaker.

1419
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:36,993
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:39,029 --> 01:21:40,096
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:41,965 --> 01:21:44,134
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1422
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:47,270
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1423
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:52,475
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1424
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:58,313
PETER: The hell happened
to this planet?

1425
01:21:58,315 --> 01:22:00,214
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1426
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:02,385
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1427
01:22:03,653 --> 01:22:07,455
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1428
01:22:07,457 --> 01:22:10,291
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1429
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:11,626
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1430
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:13,161
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1431
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:14,462
pin him down,
get what we need.

1432
01:22:14,464 --> 01:22:16,264
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1433
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:17,965
We just want the gauntlet.

1434
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,335
- Are you yawning?
- (YAWNING)

1435
01:22:20,337 --> 01:22:22,603
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1436
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,439
Did you hear what I said?

1437
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,974
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."

1438
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:28,042
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.

1439
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:31,179
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1440
01:22:31,181 --> 01:22:32,913
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1441
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,515
Kick names, take ass.

1442
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:35,918
Yeah, that's right.

1443

(SIGHS)

1444
01:22:42,492 --> 01:22:44,292
All right, just get over here,
please.

1445
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:46,361
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1446
01:22:46,363 --> 01:22:48,498
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.

1447
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:52,633
STARK: We gotta coalesce.

1448
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,469
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1449
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:57,037
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1450
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,506
We don't know what it means.

1451
01:22:58,508 --> 01:23:01,309
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1452
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:04,010
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

1453
01:23:04,012 --> 01:23:06,079
and that way
it might be really good.

1454
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,181
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1455
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:10,418
- STARK: What dance-off?
- (STAMMERS) It's nothing.

1456
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,586
Like in <i>Footloose,</i> the movie?

1457
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:13,521
Exactly like <i>Footloose.</i>

1458
01:23:13,523 --> 01:23:15,255
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1459
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:16,491
SPIDER-MAN: It never was.

1460
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:17,592
STARK: Don't encourage this,
all right?

1461
01:23:17,594 --> 01:23:19,092
- Okay.
- We're getting no help

1462
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:20,628
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?

1463
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:22,397
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1464
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:24,131
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1465
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,568
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1466
01:23:26,736 --> 01:23:28,068
that's 100% you.

1467
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:29,336
STARK: Your math
is blowing my mind.

1468
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,573
MANTIS: Excuse me.

1469
01:23:31,574 --> 01:23:35,110
But does your friend
often do that?

1470
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:38,681
Strange, we all right?

01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:50,223
You're back. You're all right.

1474
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,459
- DR. STRANGE: Hi.
- Hey, what was that?

1475
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:57,097
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1476
01:23:57,099 --> 01:23:58,598
To see all
the possible outcomes

1477
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,469
of the coming conflict.

1478
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,669
How many did you see?

1479
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,073
14,000,605.

1480
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,143
How many did we win?

1481
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,082
One.

1482
01:24:35,805 --> 01:24:39,007
THANOS: The stone
had better be up there.

1483
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:42,744
For your sister's sake.

1484
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:08,470
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1485
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:14,073
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1486
01:25:14,075 --> 01:25:15,342
THANOS: You know us?

1487
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:20,380
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1488
01:25:20,382 --> 01:25:22,116
Where is the Soul Stone?

1489
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,150
You should know...

1490
01:25:25,152 --> 01:25:28,256
it extracts a terrible price.

1491
01:25:29,525 --> 01:25:31,192
I am prepared.

1492
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:36,097
We all think that at first.

1493
01:25:40,536 --> 01:25:42,772
We are all wrong.

1494
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:56,850
THANOS: How is it you know
this place so well?

1495
01:25:56,852 --> 01:26:01,688
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.

1496
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,590
I even held one in my hand.

1497
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:08,763
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1498
01:26:08,765 --> 01:26:12,802
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1499
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:24,512
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1500
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,582
As does what you fear.

1501
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:30,349
What's this?

1502
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,918
RED SKULL: The price.

1503
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:37,623
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

1504
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:41,696
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1505
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:45,197
THANOS: Tell me what it needs.

1506
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:48,768
RED SKULL: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1507
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:51,405
understands its power...

1508
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,308
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1509
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:58,277
Of what?

1510
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:00,312
In order to take the stone,

1511
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,650
you must lose
that which you love.

1512
01:27:05,586 --> 01:27:06,821
A soul...

1513
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:08,756
for a soul.

(LAUGHING)

1515
01:27:24,538 --> 01:27:26,808
All my life,

1516
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:29,275
a moment...

1517
01:27:30,544 --> 01:27:32,613
when you got
what you deserved.

1518
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:37,217
And I was always
so disappointed.

1519
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,255
But now...

1520
01:27:46,226 --> 01:27:49,295
You kill and torture...

1521
01:27:51,264 --> 01:27:53,266
and you call it mercy.

1522
01:27:57,337 --> 01:27:59,406
The universe has judged you.

1523
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:05,445
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1524
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:08,481
You failed.

1525
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:11,686
And do you wanna know why?

1526
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:14,521
Because you love nothing.

1527
01:28:15,288 --> 01:28:16,792
No one.

01:28:22,495 --> 01:28:23,630
No.

This isn't love.

1534
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,995
I ignored my destiny once.

1535
01:28:58,565 --> 01:29:00,700
I cannot do that again.

Yes, but there are more than
